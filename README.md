# Selective Long Range Connection GNNs
This repository contains the code for my seminar papar "Enhancing Message Passing Neural Networks with Selective Long-Range Connections to Mitigate Over-Squashing"

## Usage
To run the code, you need to install the requirements first. This can be done by running
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate slrc-gnn
```
Then, you can run the code by running
```bash
python main.py
```

To configure the experiment, you can change the parameters in the call of `main.py`. The following parameters are available:
```bash
main.py [-h] [--type {GCN,GGNN,GIN,GAT}] [--max_epochs MAX_EPOCHS] [--depth DEPTH] [--last_layer {REGULAR,FULLY_ADJACENT,K_HOP}] [--max_samples MAX_SAMPLES]
               [--learning_rate LEARNING_RATE] [--stop {TRAIN,TEST}]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --type {GCN,GGNN,GIN,GAT}
                        GNN type to use
  --max_epochs MAX_EPOCHS
                        Maximum number of epochs
  --depth DEPTH         Depth of trees from NeighborsMatch dataset
  --last_layer {REGULAR,FULLY_ADJACENT,K_HOP}
                        Last layer type
  --max_samples MAX_SAMPLES
                        Maximum number of samples to use from NeighborsMatch dataset
  --learning_rate LEARNING_RATE
                        Learning rate
  --stop {TRAIN,TEST}   Stop criterion
```

## Idea
The project addresses the issue of over-squashing in processing large-scale graph data by establishing selective long-range connections in the network's final layer. This approach balances global information flow and local feature distinctiveness, improving MPNNsâ€™ applicability and accuracy in complex scenarios. The selective long-range connections are chosen by a distance measure between nodes. The distance measure is based on the shortest path between nodes in the graph.

## Datasets
The experiments are conducted on a synthetic dataset called TreeNeighborsMatch. The dataset is generated by creating a binary tree with a given depth. Next, for every leaf node a distinct number of (blue) neighbors is added. Finally, one of the distinct numbers of neighbors is chosen as the target and the same number of (blue) neighbors is added to the root node. The task is to predict the leaf node with the same number of neighbors as the root node.
